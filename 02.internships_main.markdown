## Your responsibilities

You have four responsibilities this term:

1. Give a presentation on your work.  See [Presentation organization](#presentation-organization).
   * Also come up with a question your classmates should be able to answer after your presentation.<p>

2. Write a final paper.  See [Final paper organization](#final-paper-organization).

3. Answer the presentation question and fill out peer reviews for each presentation (other than your own) on TopHat.  See [Peer review organization](#peer-review-organization)

4. CS 1950 students: send weekly reports to your instructor and advisor by email.

If your presentation is not satisfactory, you will be asked to present once more with your instructor one-on-one outside of class hours.  This will be your final chance to give a satisfactory presentation.

If you submit your final paper at least one week before the deadline, you will be provided feedback and given a chance to resubmit if your paper is not satisfactory.

## Presentation organization

1. Please sign up for a presentation date ASAP using one of the below Doodle polls.  The deadline is **8/28 (Friday)**.  If you do not submit the poll, an arbitrary date will be chosen for you.
   * [Doodle poll for 12:10 PM - 1:00 PM class (CS 1900-1010 or CS 1950-1010)]
   * [Doodle poll for 1:15 PM - 2:05 PM class (CS 1900-1060 or CS 1950-1060)]  

2. These are the expected lengths of your presentation depending on the section you signed up with:
   * 12:10 PM - 1:00 PM class (CS 1900-1010 or CS 1950-1010): 9 minute presentation with 2 minutes Q&A
   * 1:15 PM - 2:05 PM class (CS 1900-1060 or CS 1950-1060): TBD  

2. Please review [lecture on presentations]({{site.baseurl}}/lectures/lecture-on-presentations-internship.pdf) before giving your presentation.  

3. Presenters must submit their presentation slides to the "Presentation
   Slides" assignment on Canvas the day before, by **Thursday midnight**.  The
slides will be uploaded to TopHat so that they can be reviewed by your
classmates.  The preferred format is PDF or Powerpoint.  

4. Presenters must also submit a presentation question to the "Presentation
   Question" assignment on Canvas by Thursday midnight.  The purpose of this
question is two fold: 1) To force the presenter to think about what he/she
expects the audience to learn from the presentation and 2) To measure how
successful the presenter was in conveying the concept.  Choose between a
multiple choice question or a fill-in-the-blank question.

   [Multiple choice example]
  
   Q: Which color is not represented in the RGB color model?  
   a) Red  
   b) Green  
   c) Blue  
   d) Beige  

   A: d) Beige

   [Fill-in-the-blank example]

   Q: An additive color model that adds together the colors of red, green, and blue to create a color is called the ______ color model.

   A: RGB

## Final paper organization

Write a 8 - 12 page paper on your internship experience.  For details, see the [Final Paper Instructions]({{site.baseurl}}/final_paper).  PDF format is preferred.  The paper should be submitted to courseweb by midnight of **11/24**.  Please consider submitting the paper earlier to get feedback.

Most of the things I said about presentations is also relevant to the report, and also there is an example outline of the report on the final slide.  Feel free to use your own organization if you'd like but it should contain all the major components.

## Peer review organization

For each presenter, there will be a folder in TopHat containing the slides for
the presentation, the question created by the presenter, and a few peer review
questions.  Please view the [Peer Review
Form]({{site.baseurl}}/internships/review_form.txt) if you wish to see the peer
review questions beforehand.  The TopHat questions should be submitted to
TopHat by **Sunday midnight** the day after the presentation.  Please review
[tips for writing a good review]({{site.baseurl}}/review_tips).  Be specific
about what you liked and disliked.

The peer reviews will be anonymized and then provided to the presenter.  Note
that the peer reviews *will not impact the presenter's grade*.  You can give
honest feedback and scores without feeling guilty about lowering your friend's
grade.  The instructor will make the final determination on the quality of the
presentation.

The peer reviews will be made available as feedback on the "Presentation
Slides" assignment.  It will be attached as a .xlsx Excel file.  Also, the
instructor will add some more comments in the feedback comment box.

## Attendance

Attendance is highly encouraged.  But we also understand if you cannot participate synchronously due to difficulties imposed by the pandemic.  If you cannot participate, you must listen to the Panopto recordings on your own time.
